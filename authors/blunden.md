**Early Life**   
Edmund Blunden was born on the 1st of November1896, in London. He grew up in Yalding in Kent, where he developed his love of the English countryside and appreciation of nature. He became a successful poet, author and critic, and his writing style featured both poetry and prose. His love for the countryside was prevalent in his work as a writer, for example Blunden said:
 <br>
_Cricket to us was more than play,    
It was a worship in the summer sun._

**Career**   
Instead of accepting a scholarship to study Classics at Queens College in Oxford, he decided to enlist in the army for World War 1. He became the longest serving war poet after surviving two years in the trenches. During this time, he wrote some poetry of his experiences in WW1, but most of his work came in the decades after the war. He also developed a long-lasting friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow poet and war survivor. 
<br><br>
After the war, he returned to Suffolk in England where he married and had his first child, who unfortunately died at just a few weeks of age. He eventually relocated to London and began a career in literary journalism. During this time, he assisted in founding the English Reading Society. This new job allowed him to travel globally to places such as Japan, Hong Kong, and South America for teaching posts, which permitted him to help train a generation of Japanese scholars. He retired from teaching in 1964.
<br><br>
He was connected to Kent in various ways throughout his lifetime: beginning in London, moving to Yalding, and then later on to Tonbridge. 
He lived in Tonbridge, Kent, during his later years where he wrote VE Day, which was published after 75 years in 2021. His most popular piece of writing was Undertones Of War in 1928, a memoir of active service during WW1. He later died in 1974 and was buried in Long Melford. 
<br>
He is largely underestimated today as a war poet; this may be because he worked beside other great poets such as Wilfred Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, and Siegfried Sassoon. A unique feature of his poetry that neither Owen, Rosenberg nor Sassoon wrote about was his dismay at the destruction of the French countryside, again displaying his love for nature. He also acknowledged that there were moments of happiness even among all the slaughter during the war.

**Poetry**
 An extract of one of his most memorable works, _Ancre Sunshine_:
 <br><br>
_The railway trains went by, and dreamily   
I thought of them as planets in their course,   
Thought bound perhaps for Arras, how would we   
Have wondered once if through the furious force   
Murdering our world one of these same had come,   
Friendly and sensible - ‘the war’s over chum.’_
<br><br>
This illustrates how badly the war affected him for so long in his life.

**Conclusion**  
Despite all the conflict that arose during his lifetime, he contributed a lot of significant poetry to the history of literature during the 20th century.
