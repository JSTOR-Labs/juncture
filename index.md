St Augustine's Abbey was a Benedictine monastery in Canterbury, Kent, England. The abbey was founded in 598 and functioned as a monastery until its dissolution in 1538 during the English Reformation. After the abbey's dissolution, it underwent dismantlement until 1848. Since 1848, part of the site has been used for educational purposes and the abbey ruins have been preserved for their historical value.

Once a popular seaside resort where Victorians came to take the air, where day-trippers streamed off the London train to deposit themselves on the famous sandy beach, where poets including Keats and T. S. Eliot came to recuperate, and artists to paint the sunsets, and where Dreamland hummed with jingled music.

## Ramsgate

‘Royal’ Ramsgate got its nickname from visits paid by Princess Victoria in 1835 and 1836. It was a favourite destination for Victorian holiday makers, with luminaries such as Florence Nightingale staying at the impressive Granville Hotel overlooking the sea.

St Eanswythe, patron saint of Folkestone, was the granddaughter of the first English king to convert to Christianity. It was recently confirmed that her bones are still preserved in the Church of St Mary and St Eanswythe. By the late-nineteenth century this small fishing village had reinvented itself as a seaside resort, nicknamed ‘Fashionable Folkestone’.
