# An Introduction to the Visual Essay Tool

We have constructed a (very plain) visual essay site based on a single document: readme.md. We can see text in our readme.md rendered into a visual essay site based on a website visible at:

> https://juncture-digital.org//your-github-username/your-repo-name

Each unique page in your site will be based on a single Markdown (.md) file. Using Markdown is a way to add basic formatting to each page, including emphasis, lists, and links. If you're not familiar with Markdown, we describe how to use it in the next section. Even if you have never coded before, you should be able to pick up the basics in about 30 minutes. If you've learned HTML before, you'll pick it up even faster.

Beyond Markdown, we'll show you how to add image annotations, maps, and linked open data to your essays. The combination of these elements will create a visual essay where your research can speak in compelling ways unavailable in traditional print media. 

* Interactive Image Annotation- Connect to high-resolution image databases, zoom, and annotate
* Linked Open Data- Connect with data repositories containing deep, intelligently-structured information
* Video- Add moving sound and images
* Maps- Add historical and specialized maps with explanatory layers and annotations. 

All of these visualizations can be triggered automatically as readers scroll through your essay. They can also respond to user interactions. For example, if a location is mentioned in the text, a map could be automatically displayed to show the location. The user could manipulate the map to discover the relationship between locations. If a user clicks on a person's name in your essay, we can instantly create a pop-up window showing their image, biography, and accomplishments based on publicly accessible data created by other networks of scholars. One such network is Wikidata (the knowledge base behind Wikipedia) that contains over 25,000 active users who have connected over 90 million entities that describe many aspects of human knowledge such as people, places, art, and books.
