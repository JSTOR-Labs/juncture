Once a popular seaside resort where Victorians came to take the air, where day-trippers streamed off the London train to deposit themselves on the famous sandy beach, where poets including Keats and T. S. Eliot came to recuperate, and artists to paint the sunsets, where Dreamland hummed with jingled music, Margate was to suffer the fate of many other seaside towns: limping through the end of the last century with rising unemployment, dilapidated structures, organ music, and absent holiday makers abandoning the British seaside for the Costas.
