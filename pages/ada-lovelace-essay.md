Ada Lovelace (Ada King, countess of Lovelace)
10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852
Places: London (Marylebone), Nottingham (Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall), Canterbury

From early childhood, Ada Lovelace showed signs of a keen mathematical mind.
She was born into a tumultuous family, and the rift between her parents – Lord and Lady Byron – had a profound impact on Ada’s life. Lord Byron left the family shortly after Ada’s birth, so she was raised solely her mother. Lady Byron encouraged Ada’s interest in science, but forbade Ada from communicating and finding out more about her father. As a result, Ada and her mother had a strained relationship and often struggled to get along.

Ada also suffered from prolonged illness as a child – from the age of eight, she experienced severe headaches and was paralyzed after contracting measles.
Nevertheless, despite her unstable family and illness, Ada was very curious and enjoyed developing her scientific knowledge. As a teenager, she investigated the flight of birds – their wings, anatomy and abilites – and decided to write a book (Flyology) about her findings.

Throught her life, Ada got to know many scientists and mathematicians of the time – she was close friends with her tutor, Mary Somerville, and was aquainted with Sir David Brewster, Michael Faraday and Charles Dickens.

On 8 July 1835, she married William King and over their marriage they had three children, Anna Isabella, Ralph Gordon, and Byron (whom Ada named after her late father).
However, Ada is most famous for her collaboration with mathematician Charles Babbage. She met him in June 1833, and he invited Ada to see the prototype for his difference engine – she was captivated by his work and Babbage, in turn, recognized Ada’s talent and contribution.

Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated Luigi Menabrea’s article on Babbage’s machine, and contributed her own notes – she was said to be the first to see the analytical engine’s potential and her algorithm for finding Berounoulli numbers is widely cited as the first computer algorithm in history.

Ada’s work was well-received during her lifetime and recognized by her peers, but unfortunately she only lived to be 36 years old, dying of uterine cancer in 1852. Her impact and legacy not only on the field of science, but on the people who knew her, is captured in the words of Cambridge scholar Augustus De Morgan, who wrote about Ada that “had any young beginner, about to go to Cambridge, shewn the same power[s], I should have prophesied … that they would have certainly made him an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first rate eminence.”

Ada Lovelace is a significant figure in the history of computer science not just for her achievements, but also because of the obstacles she had to overcome, including gender prejudice and ill health, and remains an inspiring role model for young scientists today – Ada (the computer language created for the United States Department of Defence) was named after her, Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated on the second Tuesday of October, and in 2015, illustration of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were included in new British passports, showing the extent of her influence and importance as a pioneer of programming and science.
