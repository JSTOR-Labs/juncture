**Early Life**   
Edmund Blunden, poet, author and critic, was born on the 1st of November 1896, in London. His sister Charlotte was born three years later at Sandgate, but by 1901 the family had moved to Yalding where his parents taught at the village school. It is here that Blunden developed his love of the English countryside and appreciation of nature. A reviewer of his 1931 poetry anthology _Poems 1914-1930_ wrote:
<br>
'Two influences stand out clearly and unmistakably; that of Kent, his native countryside, and that of the war. Mr Blunden is a thorough Kentishman. That probably is why he succeeds so admirably in recreating the very soul and atmosphere of the southern counties.'[^ref1]

**Career**   
Instead of accepting a scholarship to study Classics at Queens College in Oxford, Blunden decided to enlist in the army for World War 1. He became the longest serving war poet after surviving two years in the trenches. During this time, he wrote some poetry of his experiences in WW1, but most of his work came in the decades after the war. He also developed a long-lasting friendship with Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow poet and war survivor who was born in Matfield, Kent and who shared his love of cricket.

After the war, he returned to Suffolk in England where he married and had his first child, who unfortunately died at just a few weeks of age. He eventually relocated to London and began a career in literary journalism. During this time, he assisted in founding the English Reading Society. This new job allowed him to travel globally to places such as Japan, Hong Kong, and South America for teaching posts, which permitted him to help train a generation of Japanese scholars. In 1945 his book _English Villages_ was published in which he described Yalding:
<br>
'And here, among abundance of chestnuts and elms and cedars and acacias, the village streets begin. They are by no means mathematically planned, but that is a general feature of these villages, resulting in rather more of detached beauty than of entire and immediately observable design. Another characteristic is that many of the best houses are concealed, or partly so, beyond high red walls or thick shrubberies of cherry laurel and boxtree, so that it takes time and a good deal of peeping to find out the pleasures of this parish.'[^ref3]

He retired from teaching in 1964.

**Influence**   
He was connected to Kent in various ways throughout his lifetime: beginning in London, moving to Yalding, and then later on to Tonbridge. His Parents continued to live in Yalding at Cleave's House during the 1930s and The Cottage, Vicarage Road in the 1940s.[^ref2]
He lived in Tonbridge, Kent, during his later years where he wrote 'VE Day', which was published after 75 years in 2021. His most popular piece of writing was _Undertones Of War in 1928_ a memoir of active service during WW1. He later died in 1974 and was buried in Long Melford. He is largely underestimated today as a war poet; this may be because he worked beside other great poets such as Wilfred Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, and Siegfried Sassoon. A unique feature of his poetry that neither Owen, Rosenberg nor Sassoon wrote about was his dismay at the destruction of the French countryside, again displaying his love for nature. He also acknowledged that there were moments of happiness even among all the slaughter during the war.

**Poetry**   
 An extract of one of his most memorable works, Ancre Sunshine:
> The railway trains went by, and dreamily
> I thought of them as planets in their course,
> Thought bound perhaps for Arras, how would we
> Have wondered once if through the furious force
> Murdering our world one of these same had come,
> Friendly and sensible - ‘the war’s over chum.’
 This illustrates how badly the war affected him for so long in his life.

**Conclusion**   
 Despite all the conflict that arose during his lifetime, he contributed a lot of significant poetry to the history of literature during the 20th century.
