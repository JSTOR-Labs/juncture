### Rochester Cathedral

Rochester Cathedral is the second oldest cathedral in England. It was founded on land donated by King Ethelbert in AD 604 by the Bishop Justus – a missionary who travelled to the south of England with Augustine of Canterbury to spread Christianity in the Pagan regions. As such, it features both Norman architecture (the nave and some of the crypt), as well as Gothic architecture. Additionally, it houses the 14th century Chapter Library door, which is one of the oldest doors in the country.

It arose as a site of pilgrimage in the 13th century, after the murder of ‘William of Perth’ – a Scottish baker. This was due to the shrine in which his corpse was brought, although it unfortunately no longer stands, reportedly caused miracles.

Following the successful Norman invasion of 1066, the new King William the Conqueror gifted the Cathedral and its related estates to his half-brother, Odo of Bayeux. The following mismanagement under Odo was so severe that the building was left near destroyed. After Odo’s downfall in 1072, the Cathedral came under the ownership of Bishop Gundulf in 1077. An adept architect, he organised the construction of numerous additions to the building. Among these was a tower that bears his name today. This same Bishop went on to found St Bartholomew’s Hospital, close to Rochester Cathedral.

During the civil war, Simon de Montfort desecrated the cathedral in 1264 – he stole money and destroyed documents from the Cathedral. Once he was defeated in the following year, the place saw a period of relative stability, and many parts of it were rebuilt and repaired.

Henry VIII’s policy of the dissolution of the monasteries, during the 16th century, led to the Cathedral once again falling into disrepair. The cathedral only began to be rebuilt once it was visited by William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1633, who made a complaint about the maintenance of the place: by 1634 many of its shortcomings had been fixed.
