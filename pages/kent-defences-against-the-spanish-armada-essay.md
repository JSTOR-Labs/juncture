Read Hannah Jennison's article on Kent defences againsts the Spanish Armada

According to Geoffrey Parker, the English government did not predict that the Armada were going to invade through north-east Kent, even though this is where the Romans, Saxons and Danes had invaded before.  Parma's army would have had plenty of food during the invasion, as Kent's crops were being harvested at the time. Parker’s discussion of Kent’s defences in his article “If the Armada had landed” is extremely useful in giving us a sense of how strongly Kent could have defended itself against an attack, and the potentially devastating outcome had the Spanish ships succeeded in their voyage to Britain.

Parker tells us that as part of the defences in Kent, prior to the Armada, Henry VIII had put in place artillery forts at Sandown, Deal, Walmer, Sandgate and Camber. However, he tells us that these forts were not built from structures strong enough to withstand a heavy attack like that which was planned by King Philip II of Spain. Only Upnor Castle had strong enough bastions. Canterbury and Rochester were only protected by their old medieval walls, and Rochester Castle was in a state of decay. Between Medway and Margate, there were no defences, and it is in this weak area that King Philip II intended to first land the Armada in England. Forces against Spain were not in the correct places close to the attack – with bigger defences being in place on the Isle of Wight and around the Norfolk coast.
