Once a popular seaside resort where Victorians came to take the air, where day-trippers streamed off the London train to deposit themselves on the famous sandy beach, where poets including Keats and T. S. Eliot came to recuperate, and artists to paint the sunsets, and where Dreamland hummed with jingled music.

St Eanswythe, patron saint of Folkestone, was the granddaughter of the first English king to convert to Christianity. It was recently confirmed that her bones are still preserved in the Church of St Mary and St Eanswythe. By the late-nineteenth century this small fishing village had reinvented itself as a seaside resort, nicknamed ‘Fashionable Folkestone’.
